# ========================================
#
# Requirements for existing VPC:
# - VPC must have DNS hostnames and DNS support enabled
# - Private subnets must span at least 2 Availability Zones
# - Private subnets should have tag "kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb" = "1" for internal ALBs
# - Public subnets (if provided) should have tag "kubernetes.io/role/elb" = "1" for internet-facing ALBs
# - NAT Gateways or equivalent egress path must exist for private subnets
# - Sufficient IP space in private subnets for EKS nodes and pods
